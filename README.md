# Using NNs to Approximate the Outcome of FDTD Simulation

The exposition of this project was the idea that I could see the permittivity array and guess what the result of the simulation would look like. I want to try to replicate this with NNs.

At an ideal stage, I would be able to predict the outcome of the system and generalize it to any system of any size. I am not working on that for the time being.
